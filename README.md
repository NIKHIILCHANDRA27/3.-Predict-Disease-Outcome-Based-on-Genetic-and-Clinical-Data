# 3.-Predict-Disease-Outcome-Based-on-Genetic-and-Clinical-Data
Early disease detection, particularly for life-threatening conditions such as cancer, is crucial for increasing treatment success rates and improving patient outcomes. Machine learning (ML) techniques have shown significant promise in identifying disease patterns by analyzing large volumes of genetic and clinical data. This project focuses on using supervised and unsupervised ML approaches to predict disease outcomes based on features extracted from the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset. The primary goal is to classify patients as either at risk (malignant) or not at risk (benign) and to explore clustering patterns that may reveal hidden insights in the dataset. By leveraging the power of machine learning, clinicians and researchers can make more informed, data-driven decisions.
